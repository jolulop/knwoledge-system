# Phase 3.5b Plan

## Semantic Nodes and Grounding — Claims, Concepts, Entities, Promotion, Graph

Phase 3.5b is the largest enrichment slice (ADR-0028). On top of the 3.5a per-source
summary/tags seam it adds the semantic layer: grounded **claims**, candidate **concepts**
and **entities**, the **≥2-source promotion** lifecycle, and the **bidirectional backlink
engine** backed by the SQLite graph as source of truth. It is delivered as ordered,
independently-shippable sub-slices, each tested and committed before the next, with risk
and design surface rising across them.

This plan decomposes the slices, fixes the open decisions that block them, and records the
sequencing. It is a planning document only — no production code follows from it until each
slice is implemented in turn.

---

## 1. Objective

Fill the semantic placeholders the Phase 3 backbone left (`Claims`, `Concepts Mentioned`,
`Entities Mentioned`, `Key Points`) with grounded, reviewed content, and stand up the
graph that promotion and backlinks depend on — without weakening any Phase 3/3.5a
invariant (deterministic backbone, untrusted-input boundary, citation grounding,
human-reviewed semantic/destructive change).

---

## 2. Scope

In scope:
- LLM claim extraction with mechanical citation grounding (drop-on-fail).
- Candidate concept and entity extraction with stable ids, slugs, and aliases.
- The ≥2-independent-source promotion lifecycle (candidate → active), human-reviewed.
- The SQLite graph (source of truth) and the deterministic backlink projector.
- Composition of claims/concepts/entities into Source pages, replacing placeholders.

Out of scope (later phases): cross-source synthesis and contradiction detection (3.5c);
retrieval/answering (Phase 4/5); autonomous scheduling (Phase 7).

## 3. Sub-slices and sequencing

| # | Slice | Depends on | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Citation grounding gate + structured-citation validator** | ADR-0019/0020/0026 | **DONE** (`app/workers/citations.py`, `scripts/validate_citations.py`) |
| 2 | **SQLite graph store + validator** (`db/graph.sqlite`, per-assertion edges, active-edge projection primitives, `validate_graph`) | ADR-0029/0030 | **store + validator DONE** (`app/backend/graph.py`, `scripts/validate_graph.py`); page-level backlink rendering wires in with producers (3/4) |
| 3 | **LLM claim-extraction pass** (tier-2; gated by slice 1; Claim pages; compose into Source pages) | 1, 2, ADR-0021/0022 | **3a DONE** (`app/workers/claims.py`: extract→ground→Claim pages **rendered from the graph**; active `derived_from` edges; re-extraction **supersedes** stale edges + recomposes/**tombstones** orphan pages; CLI rebuilds index + runs validators); **3b DONE** (§5b — `graph.claims_for_source`; worker resolves labels + passes data to the pure `render_source_page`; Source `Claims` section projects active `derived_from` links, byte-stable; CLI refreshes via `generate_wiki`) |
| 4 | **Candidate concepts & entities** (pages, ids, slugs, aliases; edges into the graph) | 2, ADR-0017/0021 | **DONE** (`app/workers/concepts.py`: typed nodes w/ entity_type enum + per-type ids/routing; `active` `mentions` edges, optional anchor, no verbatim grounding; deterministic stub pages rendered from the graph; Source-page Concepts/Entities projection; supersede + tombstone on re-extraction; CLI + validators). |
| 5 | **Promotion lifecycle** (≥2 independent sources; review-gated early promotion) | 2, 4, ADR-0018 | **DONE** (`app/workers/promote.py` + `scripts/promote.py`: deterministic candidate→active on ≥2 mutually-independent sources; independence from manifest provenance — comparable-key-differs / none-equal; conservative until provenance populated; auto-approves the `promote_candidate_node` item → approved + audit_log, idempotent; page status authority preserved across re-extraction). `manifests.set_provenance`. |

Rationale for ordering: slice 1 (deterministic, done) is the grounding foundation. The
**graph (slice 2) moves up front** because claims, concepts, promotion, and backlinks all
read/write it — building it first avoids reworking each producer. Producers (3, 4) then
write nodes/edges; promotion (5) is a graph computation over them.

---

## 4. The SQLite graph (slice 2)

**Authority split (decided).** The graph is authoritative for **relationships (edges)**;
the **wiki page frontmatter is authoritative for node metadata** — `id` (ADR-0021),
`title`/`slug`, lifecycle `status` (ADR-0022), and `aliases` (ADR-0017). The graph's
`nodes` table is a **derived index** rebuilt from frontmatter (id/type plus a mirrored
slug/status for edge queries and promotion), not a second authority. So ADR-0029's
"graph is source of truth" means edges; one fact has one owner, and rename/status/promotion
cannot diverge. Promotion computes over edges, *proposes* a status change that is written
to the page (the authority, review-gated for early promotion), then re-indexed.

Location: `db/graph.sqlite` (separate from `jobs.sqlite`/`llm_cache.sqlite`; covered by
backup, ADR-0014). Schema to be finalized in the slice-2 ADR; shape:

Finalized in **ADR-0030**. Shape:

```text
nodes(node_id PK, node_type, slug, status, indexed_at)   -- DERIVED index
      node_type ∈ Build Spec §6.1; concept/entity/claim/synthesis indexed from page
      frontmatter, source nodes from manifests (ADR-0008)
edges(edge_id PK, src_id, dst_id, edge_type,             -- one row per ASSERTION
      status,            -- proposed | active | rejected | superseded
      asserted_by,       -- deterministic | llm | human | authored_wikilink
      confidence, evidence_source_id, evidence_char_start, evidence_char_end,
      review_id, job_id, created_at, updated_at,
      UNIQUE(src_id, dst_id, edge_type, asserted_by,
             evidence_source_id, evidence_char_start, evidence_char_end))
      edge_type ∈ Build Spec §6.2 MINUS needs_review (review = status)
```

- **One row per assertion (decided).** A relationship is the *set* of its assertion rows
  and exists/projects iff it has an `active` assertion — so distinct evidence spans and
  coexisting LLM/human assertions never overwrite each other. The `UNIQUE` key is the
  assertion identity, so re-runs upsert idempotently without collapsing distinct spans.
- **Governed vocabulary (decided).** `edge_type` ∈ Build Spec §6.2 **minus `needs_review`**
  (review is `status`, not a relationship); `validate_graph` rejects anything else,
  including a literal `needs_review` edge. Earlier sketch types map on: `about→mentions`,
  `evidences→derived_from`, `alias_of→` frontmatter `aliases`.
- **Review-gated candidates in one table (decided).** Proposed/rejected assertions live in
  `edges` distinguished by `status`; no separate table. The **projector renders only
  `status=active`**, so a model- or prose-authored assertion enters as `proposed` (with
  `asserted_by` + `review_id`) and is invisible until approved (ADR-0018). A *deferred*
  review item leaves the assertion `proposed` (never activates or deletes it).
- **Edges are id-keyed**, so rename/merge is an id-level redirect, not graph surgery.
- The **backlink projector** is a deterministic script that renders each page's `active`
  inbound/outbound edges into its link sections — synchronized by construction (CLAUDE.md
  rules 6, 10), a pure function of the graph + page set (no wall-clock).
- **Authored wikilinks** in prose are validated edge candidates absorbed as `proposed`
  edges under review, never trusted as edges (ADR-0029).
- Idempotency: assertion upserts keyed on the full assertion identity — `(src_id, dst_id,
  edge_type, asserted_by, evidence anchor)` — via a null-safe unique index, so distinct
  spans/asserters coexist. Both endpoints must be indexed nodes first (no dangling edges).

---

## 5. Claim extraction (slice 3)

- Tier-2 (`ENRICH_MODEL_STANDARD`, default `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6`) via the 3.5a
  `LLMClient`. Untrusted-data framing as in 3.5a (ADR-0026).
- The model proposes claims, each with a **verbatim evidence quote** — it does *not* emit
  char offsets (it cannot reliably). The harness **locates** the quote in the normalized
  Markdown (whitespace-flexible) to derive `(char_start, char_end)` mechanically, then
  **every citation is run through `ground_citation` (slice 1); a claim whose quote cannot be
  located is dropped and logged** — never written.
- Surviving claims are written as Claim pages with a stable `claim_id` = `clm_` +
  sha256(normalized claim_text), **source-agnostic** (ADR-0021): the same statement from two
  sources resolves to one page with multiple `citations` + `derived_from` edges. Pages carry
  `generation_status: enriched`, `confidence`, `review_status`.
- A `derived_from` edge (claim → source, §6.2) is written **`active`** — grounded provenance,
  not a semantic judgment (ADR-0030 edge-status policy); the Source page's `Claims`
  placeholder is recomposed to list the claims (deterministic projection, like 3.5a).
- **Only graph-backed links are rendered.** Claim/Source pages emit links only for
  `active` graph edges; the template's placeholder `[[Claims/{{...}}]]` /
  `[[Sources/{{...}}]]` are omitted when empty (as the Phase 3 backbone did, ADR-0016), so
  no invented-but-valid-looking link can slip past the dangling-link check.
- Like 3.5a, claim output lands first as a per-source artifact / cache entry; the page is
  the composed view, so re-runs are idempotent and a deterministic rebuild does not churn.

### 5b. Source-page Claims projection (slice 3b — decided)

The Source page's `Claims` section becomes a projection of the graph's `active`
`derived_from` edges pointing at it (source→claims navigation; the inverse of the claim
page's source link). Decisions:

- **Renderer stays pure; the wiki worker reads the graph.** `generate_wiki` (the single
  writer of `wiki/Sources/<id>.md`) calls `graph.claims_for_source(gconn, source_id)` for
  the active claim ids, resolves a label per claim, and passes plain data
  `claims=[{claim_id, title|None}]` to `render_source_page(..., claims=claims)`.
  `render_source_page` does **no SQLite/IO** — it composes the passed-in data into the
  `Claims` section. The page's `input_fingerprint` covers the rendered claim links, so a
  source whose claims change regenerates and an unchanged one does not churn. (A separate
  in-place projector was rejected — it reintroduces the two-writers/clobber problem 3.5a
  closed.)
- **Labels: linked short titles, graceful fallback.** The worker reads the label from the
  generated **Claim page** `claim_text` frontmatter (durable, backed up — *not* the
  gitignored enrichment record), truncates to a short title, and emits
  `[[Claims/<id>|<title>]]`; if the page or label is unavailable it falls back to a bare
  `[[Claims/<id>]]`. Edges carry no display metadata; the renderer never reads pages.
- **Refresh: the `extract_claims` CLI runs `generate_wiki` afterward**, so Source `Claims`
  sections reflect newly written / superseded claims. The claim worker stays focused on
  claims+edges; the wiki worker stays the single writer. `generate_wiki` gains a read-only
  `graph_db` param.
- **Scope: Claims only.** `Concepts/Entities Mentioned` stay `_Pending semantic enrichment._`
  until slice 4.

---

## 6. Concepts & entities (slice 4 — designed)

Mirrors the claim pipeline (tier-2, fingerprint-idempotent, supersede-on-re-extraction,
pure renderer + worker-reads-graph), with concepts/entities as the nodes. Decisions:

- **Typed nodes (decided).** Extraction returns two families: **concepts** and **entities**,
  where each entity carries an `entity_type` enum `entity | person | organization | project`.
  The final type selects the **id prefix and page directory** (`cpt_`→`Concepts/`,
  `ent_`→`Entities/`, `per_`→`People/`, `org_`→`Organizations/`, `prj_`→`Projects/`;
  ADR-0021). Uncertain → default generic `entity`; a later subtype change is review-gated
  (re-keys the id). Ids are source-agnostic `<prefix>_sha256(normalized canonical name)`
  with an `aliases` list (ADR-0017); same name → one page aggregating sources; alias-merge
  is review-gated/deferred.
- **Mentions are active provenance, not approval (decided, ADR-0030/0026).** A `mentions`
  edge (source → node, §6.2) is written **`active`** with `asserted_by=llm` + confidence;
  concepts/entities are **interpretive labels and are NOT verbatim-grounded** the way claims
  are — quality comes from **≥2-source recurrence/promotion** (slice 5), not a span. An
  optional evidence anchor is stored only when a name/alias is mechanically locatable. An
  ungrounded mention is never usable as a citation for a factual claim.
- **Pages are deterministic stubs (decided).** Frontmatter: stable id, type, title,
  `aliases`, `status: candidate`, `confidence`, `generation_status: deterministic`. Body: a
  deterministic `> [!summary]` (e.g. *"Candidate concept mentioned by N source(s)."*) and a
  **Mentioned-by** section projected from the node's `active` incoming `mentions` edges
  (graph), no placeholder wikilinks. **No LLM-authored description this slice** — generated
  descriptions are deferred to a later node-id-keyed enrichment artifact (labelled
  generated/unverified, with merge rules), after promotion exists.
- **Source-page projection.** The Source page's `Concepts/Entities Mentioned` sections
  project the source's `active` outgoing `mentions` edges — same pure-renderer +
  worker-reads-graph pattern as 3b (graph-backed links only).

---

## 7. Promotion lifecycle (slice 5 — DONE)

- A candidate concept/entity promotes to `active` once **≥2 mutually-independent sources**
  mention it (ADR-0018), computed from the graph's `active` `mentions` edges. Promotable
  types: concept + the entity family (entity/person/organization/project).
- **Independence (tightened, implemented).** Exact (SHA256) duplicates share one `source_id`
  and count once. Two sources are independent iff there is **≥1 *comparable* provenance key
  (known on both) whose values differ AND no comparable key is equal**; non-comparable or
  unknown keys never prove independence (so `author=Alice` vs `publisher=Acme` is *not*
  independent, but `author=Alice` vs `author=Bob` is). A candidate promotes on any
  independent pair among its mentioners.
- **Values are canonicalized before comparison** so trivial variants don't read as
  independent: text keys are whitespace-collapsed + case-folded; `canonical_url` is
  additionally stripped of a `#fragment` and trailing slashes (no `www.`/scheme rewriting —
  that would risk false *merges*). `set_provenance(field=None)` clears a field back to
  unknown so a bad value can be corrected away (and may withdraw a promotion's basis).
- **Early promotion (review).** If a node's `promote_candidate_node` item is already
  *approved* when the worker runs, it promotes regardless of source count — the human
  early-promotion path (ADR-0018). No recurrence audit entry is added (the loop is closed).
- **Auto-resolve + idempotent.** A recurrence promotion flips the page `status` (the
  authority) to `active`, mirrors `nodes.status`, and closes the loop deterministically —
  it **creates** the `promote_candidate_node` item if missing (legacy/hand-deleted state),
  then **approves** it (pending → approved + one `audit_log`); a rerun skips already-active
  nodes and writes no duplicate audit. The promoted status is **preserved across
  re-extraction** (page is the status authority). The `validate_projection` validator
  enforces page-frontmatter status == graph `nodes.status` on Claim and node pages; on an
  unhandled error the `promote` job is recorded `failed`. A separate, rerunnable
  `scripts/promote.py` (no LLM).
- **Provenance-metadata prerequisite (decided).** Independence detection needs source
  provenance the manifest does not carry today. Slice 5 first models optional manifest
  fields — `author`, `publisher`, `report_family`, `canonical_url` (all null when unknown)
  — and **until they are populated, promotion only *proposes* (human-reviewed), it never
  auto-activates**, so same-family sources can never silently auto-promote. Auto-promotion
  on recurrence turns on only where independence can actually be established.
- Early promotion and all entity merge/split, contradiction resolution, and deprecation
  are **human-reviewed** (ADR-0018, `policies/review.yaml`) — the LLM proposes, never
  executes.

---

## 8. Decisions and remaining open items

**Decided (this review):**
- **Node authority** — graph owns edges; wiki frontmatter owns node metadata (id/title/
  slug/status/aliases); graph `nodes` is a derived index (§4).
- **Edge vocabulary** — Build Spec §6.2 only, enforced by `validate_graph` (§4).
- **Candidate edges** — one `edges` table with `status`+provenance; projector renders only
  `status=active` (§4).
- **Promotion independence** — model optional provenance manifest fields; review-gate
  promotion until populated (§7).
- **Graph-backed links only** — renderers omit placeholder/non-`active`-edge links (§5/§6).

**Still open, resolved when each slice starts:**
- **Graph schema** (slice 2): formalized in **ADR-0030**; only the final column *types*
  remain to tune during implementation.
- **`claim_id` + edge status** (slice 3): **decided** — `clm_` + sha256(normalized
  claim_text), source-agnostic; grounded `derived_from`/`mentions` edges are `active`,
  semantic judgments + prose wikilinks are `proposed` (ADR-0030).
- **Source-page composition** (slices 3/4): claims/concepts rendered from artifacts +
  graph, preserving the 3.5a single-writer / fingerprint-idempotent property. (Producer
  in 3a; Source-page `Claims` projection in 3b.)
- **Independence heuristic** (slice 5): how `report_family`/`publisher`/`canonical_url`
  are derived and the confidence weighting.

---

## 9. Validators (extend the lint suite)

- `validate_citations.py` — **done** (slice 1): structured grounding of claim citations.
- New `validate_graph.py` (slice 2): every edge references existing node ids; `edge_type`
  is within Build Spec §6.2 and `status` within the allowed set; the backlink projection
  in pages matches the graph's `active` edges (round-trips without divergence); no
  slug-keyed edges; `proposed`/`rejected` edges are never projected.
- `validate_wiki.py` extensions (slices 3/4): claim/concept/entity pages carry required
  frontmatter and stable ids; candidate concepts stay out of promoted navigation.

---

## 10. Testing plan (per slice, before commit)

Mirrors the ADR-0028 acceptance contract; all deterministic pieces are tested offline,
LLM passes are tested with the fake-adapter `LLMClient` (as in 3.5a).

- Slice 2 (graph): assertion upsert idempotency; **multiple evidence spans / asserters**
  for the same `(src, dst, edge_type)` coexist as separate rows and do not overwrite each
  other; rename = id-level redirect preserves assertions; **review-gated** — `proposed`,
  `rejected`, and `superseded` assertions never project, an `active` one does, and a
  **deferred** review item leaves the assertion `proposed` (neither activated nor deleted);
  **edge vocabulary** — an `edge_type` outside §6.2-minus-`needs_review` fails
  `validate_graph` (a literal `needs_review` edge is rejected), each allowed type maps to
  its §6.2 semantics; **node authority** — a rename/status change has exactly one source of
  truth (frontmatter/manifest) and a deterministic projection, and rebuilding the `nodes`
  index does not mutate any edge; **write integrity** — `upsert_assertion` rejects an
  unknown `src_id`/`dst_id`, a raw duplicate is rejected by the null-safe unique index, and
  `set_status` raises on an unknown edge; **endpoint types** — a `derived_from` with a
  `source` src (or any matrix violation) fails `validate_graph`. *(The page-level projector
  round-trip — page links match `active` assertions — is a slice 3/4 acceptance item, once
  producers wire the projector into pages; slice 2 ships the store, the active-edge
  projection primitives, and the integrity validator.)*
- Slice 3 (claims): a claim whose citation fails grounding is dropped; a grounded claim
  writes a page + `derived_from` edge; re-run is idempotent and the Source page does not
  churn; **no placeholder `[[Claims/{{...}}]]`/`[[Sources/{{...}}]]` survives rendering**.
- Slice 4 (concepts/entities): pages get stable ids + aliases; `mentions` edges written;
  only graph-backed links rendered.
- Slice 5 (promotion): same source, duplicate (same-`source_id`) source, same-family
  source, and two independent sources each behave correctly — 1 source → `candidate`,
  2 independent → `active`, same-family 2nd → review item (never auto-promotion), and
  promotion only proposes while provenance fields are unpopulated.

---

## 11. Non-goals (3.5b)

- Cross-source synthesis and contradiction detection (3.5c).
- Retrieval, ranking, and cited answering (Phase 4/5).
- Autonomous/scheduled enrichment (Phase 7).
- Concrete local-model deployment (only the adapter seam is fixed, ADR-0025).

---

## 12. Completion

3.5b is complete when extracted sources carry grounded claims and candidate
concepts/entities, the graph is the source of truth with backlinks projected from it,
promotion runs on independent-source recurrence with review gating, and the full validator
suite (citations + graph + wiki) passes. Synthesis/contradiction (3.5c) follows on the
proven graph.
